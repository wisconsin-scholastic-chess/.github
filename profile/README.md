> Many studies have shown the benefits of chess in education. Peter Dauvergne, a Canadian chess master and former senior lecturer in the Faculty of Economics and Business at the University of Sydney, Australia, surveyed those studies and in 2000 published the following list of what chess does for children: 

> - Raises intelligence quotient (IQ) scores 
> - Strengthens problem-solving skills, teaching children how to make difficult and abstract decisions independently 
> - Enhances reading, memory, language, and mathematical abilities 
> - Fosters critical, creative, and original thinking 
> - Provides practice at making accurate and fast decisions under time pressure, a skill that can help improve test scores 
> - Teaches how to think logically and efficiently, learning to select the ‘best’ choice from a large number of options 
> - Challenges gifted children, including those who are underachieving, to learn how to study and strive for excellence 
> - Demonstrates the importance of flexible planning, concentration, and the consequences of decisions 
> - Reaches boys and girls regardless of their natural abilities or socio economic backgrounds 

> Given these educational benefits, Dauvergne concludes that, “The case, then, is exceptionally strong for using chess to develop our children’s minds and help them cope with the growing complexities and demands of a globalising world.”
